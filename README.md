# CS2 Commend Bot (Commendbot) – 2025 Guide

This repository explains how **CS2 commend bots** (also known as *commendbot* or *commend bot*) work in 2025, why most public downloads are unsafe, and which alternatives actually function in CS2.

## ❗ Do CS2 commendbots still work?

Most public *commendbot* tools are:

- Broken (outdated CS:GO code)
- Fake downloads / malware
- Token stealers
- Videos with fake “working” showcases
- Scripts that no longer work with CS2's updated Steam backend

Running your own commendbot requires:

- Dozens of Steam accounts  
- Proxies  
- Session/key management  
- GC message handling  
- Constant maintenance

This is why almost all “free CS2 commend bot downloads” are scams.
